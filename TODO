Decide whether the emulator prints decimal or hex numbers.

Whatever endianess is decided upon, needs to be enforced in the
emulator, assembler and fs utilities.

Implement the SD card library and possibly use it in the BIOS.

Determine sane offsets/sizes for the memory layout. I.e. placement and
size of kernel, kernel's stack, mmap I/O region, standard library, etc.

Implement malloc and free in the standard library.

Kernel should use malloc and free to spawn new tasks.

Finish interrupt implementation in the emulator and add a task switcher
interrupt handler to the kernel.

Figure out exactly how SPI will work.

Port to a microcontroller to begin testing with real peripherals.

Pick LCD and figure out an SPI interface.

Begin hardware implementation.
