Decide whether the emulator prints decimal or hex numbers.

Whatever endianess is decided upon, needs to be enforced in the
emulator, assembler and fs utilities.

DONE - Option for assembler to begin PC at certain value.
       The --base-address option was added to the assembler for this.

Assembler should export labels to ABI file so others can reference it.

Implement the FS library and possibly use it in the BIOS.

Determine sane offsets/sizes for the memory layout. I.e. placement and
size of kernel, kernel's stack, mmap I/O region, standard library, etc.

Implement malloc and free in the standard library.

Kernel should use malloc and free to spawn new tasks.

Finish interrupt implementation in the emulator and add a task switcher
interrupt handler to the kernel.

Figure out exactly how SPI will work.

Port to a microcontroller to begin testing with real peripherals.

Pick LCD and figure out an SPI interface.

Begin hardware implementation.
