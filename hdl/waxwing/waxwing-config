Download the open source loader:

	git clone https://github.com/amilkovich/numato-loader.git
	cd numato-loader

Edit the 'numato-loader.c' and change the DESCRIPTION macro to:

	#define DESCRIPTION "Waxwing Spartan 6 FPGA Board"

Alternatively, just get this fork with all the changes made:
	https://github.com/modernrio/saturn-loader.git

Build the loader:

	make
	./numato-loader -l

Create a new project in WebPACK ISE with these properties:

	Family Spartan6
	Device XC6SLX45
	Package CSG324
	Speed -2

Add a new verilog module and right click on the "Generate Programming File" process.
Click on "Process Properties" and check the "Create Binary Configuration File" option.
This will produce a .bin file in addition to the usual .bit file. The .bin file
is what you use to program the chip.

You can determine the speed rating based on the package marking.
Read the fine print on the FPGA IC itself and reference this document:
